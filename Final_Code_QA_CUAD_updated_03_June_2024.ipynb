Each party agrees that, during the Term and for two (2) years thereafter: (i) it will not disclose to any third party any Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other party except as expressly permitted in this Agreement; (ii) it will only permit access to Confidential Information of the disclosing party to those of its employees or authorized representatives or advisors (including, without limitation, the receiving party\\'s auditors, accountants, and attorneys) having a need to know and who, prior to obtaining such access, are legally bound to protect the disclosing party\\'s Confidential Information at least to the same extent as set forth herein; (iii) it will use any Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other party only for the purpose of performing its obligations or exercising its rights under this Agreement and not for any other purpose, whether for such party\\'s own benefit or the benefit of any third party; (iv) it will maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential Information of the other party in its possession or control; and (v) that (x) upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement, or (y) at any time the disclosing party may so request, it will deliver promptly to the disclosing party, or, at the disclosing party\\'s option, it will destroy, all Confidential Information of the disclosing party that it may then possess or have under its control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party may disclose Confidential Information of the other party to the extent required by a court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental authority or otherwise as required by law, provided that such party will, as soon as reasonably practicable, provide the disclosing party with written notice of such requirement so that the disclosing party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. The receiving party and its representatives will cooperate fully with the disclosing party to obtain any such protective order or other remedy. If the disclosing party elects not to seek, or is unsuccessful in obtaining, any such protective order or similar remedy and if the receiving party receives advice from reputable legal counsel confirming that the disclosure of Confidential Information is required pursuant to applicable law, then the receiving party may disclose such Confidential Information to the extent required; provided, however, that the receiving party will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such Confidential Information is treated confidentially by each party to which it is disclosed.\\n\\n15. Disclaimers.\\n\\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN SECTION 12, THE PARTIES HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CONCERNING THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT.\\n\\n12\\n\\nSource: IDEANOMICS, INC., 10-K, 3/30/2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n16. Limitation of Liability.\\n\\nEXCEPT FOR THE ABOVE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS AND FOR BREACHES OF SECTION 14, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF PROFITS), WHETHER IN AN ACTION OR ARISING OUT OF BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\\n\\n17. Miscellaneous.\\n\\n(a) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in all respects in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles.\\n\\n(b) Dispute Resolution. Any dispute, controversy and/or difference which may arise out of or in connection with or in relation to this Agreement, shall be solely and finally settled by binding arbitration pursuant to then-current rules of the International Chamber of Commerce. Such arbitration shall be held in New York, New York. The merits of the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to its choice of law rules. The tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators, each of whom shall be knowledgeable in the subject matter hereof. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language, and all documents shall be submitted in English or be accompanied by a certified English translation. The arbitrators will provide a written explanation to the parties of any arbitration award. The award thereof shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto, and judgment on such award may be entered in any court or tribunal having jurisdiction, and the parties hereby irrevocably waive any objection to the jurisdiction of such courts based on any ground, including without limitation, improper venue or forum non conveniens. The parties and the arbitration panel shall be bound to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement, the dispute and any award, except to the extent necessary to enforce any such award. The prevailing party, if a party is so designated in the arbitration award, shall be entitled to recover from the other party its costs and fees, including attorneys\\' fees, associated with such arbitration. By agreeing to this binding arbitration provision, the parties understand that they are waiving certain rights and protections which may otherwise be available if a dispute between the parties were determined by litigation in court, including, without limitation, the right to seek or obtain certain types of damages precluded by this arbitration provision, the right to a jury trial, certain rights of appeal, and a right to invoke formal rules of procedure and evidence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each party shall be entitled, at any time, without first resorting to the dispute resolution process set forth above, to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, wherever such party deems appropriate, in order to preserve or enforce such party\\'s rights hereunder.\\n\\n13\\n\\nSource: IDEANOMICS, INC., 10-K, 3/30/2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) Non-Exclusivity. Nothing in this Agreement limits or restricts Licensee from entering into any similar agreements with any third party.\\n\\n(d) Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal, such provision shall be deemed restated, in accordance with applicable law, to reflect as nearly as possible the original intentions of the parties, and the remainder of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\\n\\n(e) Waiver. No term or condition of this Agreement shall be deemed waived, and no breach shall be deemed excused, unless such waiver or excuse is in writing and is executed by the party against whom such waiver or excuse is claimed.\\n\\n(f) Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement and understanding between the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous oral or written agreements and representations with respect to such subject matter. This Agreement may be modified or amended only in a writing signed by all parties.\\n\\n(g) Jury Trial Waiver. THE PARTIES SPECIFICALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY COURT WITH RESPECT TO ANY CONTRACTUAL, TORTIOUS, OR STATUTORY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM, OR CROSS-CLAIM AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR CONNECTED IN ANY WAY TO THIS AGREEMENT, BECAUSE THE PARTIES HERETO, BOTH OF WHOM ARE REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL, BELIEVE THAT THE COMPLEX COMMERCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL ASPECTS OF THEIR DEALINGS WITH ONE ANOTHER MAKE A JURY DETERMINATION NEITHER DESIRABLE NOR APPROPRIATE.\\n\\n(h) Assignment. Neither party may assign its rights, duties or obligations under this Agreement to any third party in whole or in part, without the other party\\'s prior written consent, except that (i) Licensee may assign its rights and obligations to this Agreement to any of its Affiliate or subsidiaries with the prior written consent of the Licensor, and (ii) Licensor may assign its rights and obligations in this Agreement to its Affiliates or subsidiaries and either party may assign this Agreement in its entirety to any purchaser of all or substantially all of its business or assets pertaining to the line of business to which this Agreement relates or to any Affiliate of the party without the other party\\'s approval.
