            "DURHAM, N.C. and BRIDGEWATER, N.J., Sept. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Dova\") (DOVA), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing, and commercializing drug candidates for diseases where there is a high unmet need, and Salix Pharmaceuticals (\"Salix\"), one of the largest specialty pharmaceutical companies in the world committed to the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases and its parent company, Bausch Health Companies Inc. (NYSE/TSX: BHC), today announced that they have entered into an exclusive agreement to co-promote Dova's DOPTELET (avatrombopag) in the United States (U.S.). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") approved DOPTELET on May 21, 2018 for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) who are scheduled to undergo a procedure. DOPTELET represents the first thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist approved in the United States for this indication.\n",
            "\n",
            "Thrombocytopenia, a condition in which patients have a low platelet count, is the most common hematological abnormality in patients with CLD that often worsens with the severity of liver disease. It is estimated that approximately 15 percent of the 7.5 million patients with CLD have some form of thrombocytopenia. In a study published in 2010, patients with severe thrombocytopenia (<75,000/µL) had a 31 percent incidence of procedure-related bleeding. As a result of the associated increased rate of bleeding, there is an increased risk for the CLD patient when undergoing common scheduled medical procedures such as liver biopsy, colonoscopy, endoscopy, and routine dental procedures.\n",
            "\n",
            "As part of the co-promotion arrangement, Salix intends to deploy approximately 100 sales specialists who will promote DOPTELET to gastroenterology healthcare professionals. The Salix sales force will begin selling DOPTELET in mid-October 2018. Dova will continue its commercial efforts targeting primarily hepatologists and interventional radiologists and certain other specialties. Pursuant to the agreement, Dova will pay Salix a quarterly fee based on net sales (as defined in the agreement) of DOPTELET prescribed by gastroenterologists in the U.S.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"We are delighted to be working with Salix, a company considered by many to have the preeminent gastroenterology sales force in the United States,\" said Alex C. Sapir, president and chief executive officer, Dova Pharmaceuticals. \"Given Salix's presence and strong reputation within large gastroenterology group practices coupled with the early interest we are seeing among the gastroenterology community, we are excited to see the impact this partnership will bring to DOPTELET and to patients.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Salix considers liver disease a strategic therapeutic area of focus, given our history and knowledge with XIFAXAN® (rifaximin), an innovative medicine indicated for the treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a condition that is often a consequence of chronic liver disease,\" said Mark McKenna, president, Salix Pharmaceuticals. \"Adding DOPTELET to our portfolio will enable our sales force to promote yet another innovative product that addresses a true unmet need in the marketplace.\"\n",

DOPTELET is designed to mimic the effects of TPO, the primary regulator of normal platelet production.\n",

            "Two global Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (ADAPT-1 [N=231] and ADAPT-2 [N=204]), conducted in adults with thrombocytopenia (platelet count of less than 50,000/µL) and CLD, supported the FDA approval. Patients were assigned to either 40 mg or 60 mg of avatrombopag daily for five days based on their Baseline platelet counts (40 to <50,000/µmL or <40,000/µmL, respectively). Avatrombopag was shown to be superior to placebo in increasing the proportion of patients not requiring platelet transfusions or rescue procedures for bleeding up to seven days following a scheduled procedure in both trials in both the 40 mg (ADAPT-1, 88% vs. 38%, p <0.0001; ADAPT-2, 88% vs. 33%; p<0.0001), and 60 mg (ADAPT-1, 66% vs. 23%, p <0.0001; ADAPT-2, 69% vs. 35%; p=0.0006) treatment groups. Avatrombopag was also superior to placebo at the two secondary efficacy endpoints in each trial. In the avatrombopag treatment groups, there was an increased proportion of patients achieving the target platelet count of ≥50,000/µmL on procedure day, and a greater magnitude of the change in mean platelet count from baseline to procedure day; all treatment differences between the avatrombopag and placebo treatment groups for each secondary endpoint were highly statistically significant with p values <0.0001. The most common adverse reactions with avatrombopag included pyrexia, abdominal pain, nausea, headache, fatigue and edema peripheral. Portal vein thromboses have been reported in patients with CLD and in patients receiving TPO receptor agonists. One treatment-emergent event of portal vein thrombosis was reported in the ADAPT trials in an avatrombopag-treated patient.\n",

During the Term and for a period of [***] ([***]) months following the Term of this Agreement, other than pursuant to Sections 13.3.2 (Effects of Termination Based Upon Ginkgo\\'s Buy-Down Election) or 13.3.3 (Effects of Termination Based Upon an Uncured Ginkgo Breach, Insolvency or Force Majeure Event), BLI shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, itself or with or through a Third Party, develop, configure, customize, license, sell, provide or otherwise give access to the Beacon Platform or any [***] to, [***] or its Affiliates for any use; provided that this restriction shall terminate as set forth in Section 13.3 (Effects of Expiration or Termination) or if Ginkgo has not satisfied its Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments (as such may be adjusted under this Agreement) for a full Contract Year, including [***] as permitted under Section 7.2.2(a) (Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments) or Section 7.2.2(b)(iii) (Development Purchase Commitments); provided that BLI will provide written notice to Ginkgo within [***] ([***]) days of the end of any Contract Year with respect to which BLI believes that Ginkgo has not satisfied its Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a Change in Control of an existing (as of the Effective Date or at any time during the Term) Third Party BLI customer results in such customer being controlled [***] following the date such Third Party became a BLI customer, BLI shall promptly notify Ginkgo in writing of such Change in Control (in no event later than [***] ([***]) days after BLI first learns of such Change in Control, [***] (in which case such notice will be provided by BLI no later than [***] ([***]) days after the earlier of [***] or [***]) and, in such written notice, provide Ginkgo with information regarding [***] and, if BLI does [***], the [***].

As used in this Section 6.2.1 (Restrictions on BLI), \"control\" has the meaning set forth in Section 1.2 (\"Affiliate\" definition). For clarity, [***].\\n\\n6.2.2 No Further Restrictions by Ginkgo. During the Term, Ginkgo shall not [***] prohibit (i.e. by [***]), as part of any [***] arrangement with a Third Party, a Third Party from purchasing a Beacon Platform or other BLI products or services, or otherwise using or utilizing such Beacon Platforms for [***], including [***].

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, during the Term, the Parties\\' target is for Ginkgo to make a total of One Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($150,000,000) in Development Purchases and Production Purchases from BLI (as amended from time to time under this Agreement and as more fully set forth in this Section 7.2 (Purchase Commitments), the \"Full Purchase Target\"), which Full Purchase Target is divided into Contract Year purchase commitment targets with respect to Development Purchase Commitment and Production Purchase Targets, as more fully set forth in Section 7.2.2 (Contract Year Purchase Targets and Commitments).\\n\\n7.2.2 Contract Year Purchase Targets and Commitments. Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including the remainder of this Section 7.2.2 (Contract Year Purchase Targets and Commitments)), for each Contract Year, Ginkgo shall [***] make Development Purchases and Production Purchases from BLI in the amounts set forth in the Page 36 of 85\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Development Purchase Commitment\" and \"Production Purchase Target\" columns respectively in Table 7.2.2 with respect to such Contract Year:\\n\\nTable 7.2.2\\n\\nDevelopment Purchase Commitment\\n\\nProduction Purchase Target\\n\\nTotal Targeted Purchase\\n\\nMinimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment Contract Year 1 $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] Contract Year 2 $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] Contract Year 3 $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] Contract Year 4 $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] Contract Year 5 $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] Contract Year 6 $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] Contract Year 7 [***] $ [***] $ [***] $ 109,000,000 Total $ [***] $ [***] $150,000,000 N/A\\n\\n(a) Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments. With respect to each Contract Year, by no later than [***], Ginkgo shall have incurred (including all credits and offsets permitted under this Agreement) at least, in the aggregate since the beginning of the Term, the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment amount for such Contract Year. The Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments for each of Contract Years [***] are binding commitments. Any amounts paid by Ginkgo to BLI in excess of the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment amount for a given Contract Year in Contract Years [***], regardless of whether such excess constitutes a Development Purchase or Production Purchase, will be creditable towards the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment in subsequent Contract Year(s) until such excess amount has been fully credited. Ginkgo covenants to pay the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments for each Contract Year by the [***] Business Day after the end of the [***]. If BLI has Substantially Completed at least [***] ([***]) [***] Workflows within the first [***] ([***]) Contract Years, then the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment as of the Contract Year (which may include a portion of a full Contract Year) that is the last Contract Year during the Term pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall change from $109 million (as currently reflected in Table 7.2.2) to $150 million.\\n\\n(b) Development Purchase Commitments.\\n\\n(i) Subject to Section 7.2.2(a) (Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments), unless the Parties otherwise mutually agree in writing, the Development Purchase Commitment for the [***] Contract Years shall constitute a binding obligation on Ginkgo, and, subject to Ginkgo exercising its Buy-Down Option pursuant to Section 7.3 (Buy-Down Election), the Development Purchase Commitment for the [***] Contract Years shall also constitute binding obligations on Ginkgo. No less than [***] percent ([***]%) of the Development Purchases made in the [***] Contract Years will be used by the Parties to develop Workflows for [***]. Page 37 of 85\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(ii) At any time during a Contract Year, upon written notice to the JRC, Ginkgo may accelerate its Development Purchases in such Contract Year to include Development Purchases anticipated to be made in upcoming Contract Year(s). Such additional Development Purchases in excess of the Development Purchase Commitment for such Contract Year will be creditable towards Ginkgo\\'s Development Purchases in subsequent Contract Year(s) until such excess amount has been exhausted and will count towards the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment for the Contract Year in which it is paid, subject to allocation to subsequent Contract Year(s) as set forth in Section 7.2.2(a) (Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments).\\n\\n(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that Ginkgo\\'s Development Purchases in a given Contract Year after [***] are less than the Development Purchase Commitment for such Contract Year, respectively, Ginkgo shall be able to apply the Development Purchases made in the first [***] of the next Contract Year to satisfy the previous Contract Year\\'s Development Purchase Commitment; provided that (i) Ginkgo may only be able to satisfy [***] percent ([***]%) of the relevant Development Purchase Commitment for the previous Contract Year pursuant to this Section 7.2.2(b)(iii) (Development Purchase Commitments) and (ii) any amount of Development Purchases credited towards satisfying the previous Contract Year\\'s Development Purchase Commitment shall not count towards satisfying such targets for the then-current Contract Year.\\n\\n(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that a Workflow Development Plan is terminated prior to completion by the JRC, including (A) [***], (B) [***], (C) [***] or (D) [***], then, subject to Section 3.5.1 (Decision-Making), the JRC shall, in good faith, discuss and approve [***]; provided, however, that such [***] (Term).\\n\\n(c) Production Purchase Commitments.\\n\\n(i) Subject to this Section 6.2.2(c) (Production Purchase Commitments), unless the Parties otherwise mutually agree in writing, the Production Purchase Target for the [***] shall constitute a binding obligation on Ginkgo and, in partial satisfaction of its Production Purchase commitment for the Page 38 of 85\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[***], Ginkgo shall purchase [***] ([***]) [***] within [***] ([***]) days of the Effective Date, the cost of which, for clarity, shall be offset by the upfront payment paid by Ginkgo pursuant to Section 7.1 (Upfront Payment). Subject to Ginkgo\\'s obligation to satisfy the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment for a Contract Year, with respect to the second [***] Contract Years), Ginkgo\\'s Production Purchase Targets for the [***] Contract Years as set forth in Table 7.2.2 are [***], and the Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that [***].\\n\\n(ii) At any time during a Contract Year, upon written notice to the JRC, Ginkgo may accelerate its Production Purchases in such Contract Year to include Production Purchases anticipated to be made in upcoming Contract Year(s). Such additional Production Purchases in excess of the Production Purchase Target for such Contract Year will be creditable towards Ginkgo\\'s Production Purchases in subsequent Contract Year(s) until such excess amount has been exhausted and will count towards the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment.\\n\\n(d) Effects of Tolling. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Ginkgo\\'s obligations to satisfy Development Purchase Commitments and Production Purchase Commitments at all times during the Term (including any Intended End of Term) are subject to Section 5.4.3(d) (Tolling) and this Section 7.2.2(d) (Effects of Tolling).

In the event Ginkgo notifies BLI of its Buy-Down Election as set forth in this Section 7.3 (Buy-Down Election), then, upon Ginkgo\\'s payment of the Buy-Down Amount to BLI within [***] ([***]) days of Ginkgo\\'s Buy-Down Election, this Agreement shall automatically terminate, with the applicable effects of termination set forth in Section 13.3.2 (Effects of Termination Based Upon Ginkgo\\'s Buy-Down Election).\\n\\n7.4 Additional Payments.\\n\\n7.4.1 License Fees. During the Term, and in consideration for the rights granted herein, Ginkgo shall pay field of use license fees (\"FOU License Fees\") as follows: (a) with respect to any calendar year, no FOU License Fees will be due until [***] and (b) [***] ($[***]) per calendar year per Beacon Optofluidic Machine [***] up to a Page 39 of 85\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmaximum of [***] ($[***]) per calendar year per Beacon Optofluidic Machine; provided that, in no event will the FOU License Fees paid by Ginkgo for use of a Beacon Optofluidic Machine [***].

In the event that termination is the result of an uncured, material Ginkgo breach of the Agreement under Section 13.2.1 (Material Breach), for Ginkgo\\'s insolvency pursuant to Section 13.2.2 (Bankruptcy) or for an Extended Force Majeure Event with respect to Ginkgo pursuant to Section 14.8 (Force Majeure), then, as of the effective date of termination: (a) any and all existing Headstart Periods shall immediately be deemed to have accelerated to conclusion, (b) the restrictions on BLI set forth in Section 6.2.1 (Restrictions on BLI) shall immediately deemed to have terminated; (c) the licenses granted to BLI from Ginkgo pursuant to Section 9.2 (Grants to BLI) shall survive, (d) the licenses granted to Ginkgo under Sections 9.1.1(c) (Grants to Ginkgo - Commercial License) and 9.1.2 (License Grant to Page 58 of 85\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExploit [***]) shall survive, but shall convert immediately into royalty-bearing licenses as set forth in subclause (e) hereof, (e) Ginkgo shall to pay to BLI [***]; provided that in the event such uncured material breach is [***], Ginkgo, at its election to be made on or before the [***] ([***]t h) day following the effective date of termination (or, if later, within [***] ([***]) days of learning of the relevant royalties for Licensed Products), may elect, in lieu of royalties, to pay to BLI [***]; (f) the pricing terms for Beacon Optofluidic Machines, Consumables, and services (including Services) shall be consistent with then-current BLI List Prices; and (g) Ginkgo shall pay BLI for any amounts due for work performed by BLI under and in accordance with this Agreement prior to the effective date of termination or materials ordered prior to the effective date of termination to the extent that BLI cannot reasonably cancel or reallocate such work or materials.\\n\\n13.3.4 Effects of Termination Based Upon an Uncured BLI Breach or Insolvency.

If any such uncured, material BLI breach is solely due to BLI\\'s material failure to perform its supply-related obligations under this Agreement, Section 13.4 (Rights in Lieu of Termination for BLI\\'s Material Breach of Supply Obligations) may apply in Ginkgo\\'s sole discretion.\\n\\n13.3.5 Effects of Termination Based Upon Ginkgo\\'s Election to Terminate based on a BLI Extended Force Majeure Event. In the event that termination is elected by Ginkgo based upon an Extended Force Majeure Event with respect to BLI pursuant to Section 13.2.1 (Force Majeure), then, as of the effective date of termination: (a) any and all existing Headstart Periods shall survive for their duration as if this Agreement had not been terminated, (b) the restrictions on BLI set forth in Section 6.2.1 (Restrictions on BLI) shall survive to the extent set forth therein as if this Agreement had not been terminated; (c) the licenses granted to Ginkgo from BLI in Section 9.1.1 (Scope of Grants) and 9.1.2 (License Grant to Exploit [***]) shall survive and become perpetual, irrevocable and, subject to clause (f) of this Section 13.3.2, royalty-free; (d) the licenses granted to BLI Page 59 of 85\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfrom Ginkgo pursuant to Section 9.2 (Grants to BLI) shall survive; (e) any Licensed Products arising from Collaboration Workflows or Ginkgo Workflows developed or used by Ginkgo to good effect prior to the effective date of termination shall be royalty-free and no royalties shall be payable by Ginkgo on any sale or transfer of such Licensed Product; provided that, if [***], if [***], then, in order for the sale or transfer of Licensed Products arising from Collaboration Workflows or Ginkgo Workflows developed or used by Ginkgo to good effect prior to the effective date of termination to be royalty-free, Ginkgo must pay to BLI [***], but Ginkgo will have [***] ([***]) days following the effective date of termination to decide whether to make such payment to BLI or to pay royalties for such Licensed Products under subclause (f) of this Section 13.3.5 (Effects of Termination Based Upon Ginkgo\\'s Election to Terminate based on a BLI Extended Force Majeure Event), (f) (i) for any Licensed Products arising from Workflows other than as set forth in subclause (e) of this Section 13.3.5 (Effects of Termination Based Upon Ginkgo\\'s Election to Terminate based on a BLI Extended Force Majeure Event), Ginkgo shall pay [***] and (ii) Ginkgo shall pay [***]; provided that, if [***], then [***], (g) the pricing terms for Beacon Optofluidic Machines, Consumables, and services (including Services) shall be consistent with then-current BLI List Prices and (h) Ginkgo shall pay BLI for any amounts due for work performed by BLI under and in accordance with this Agreement prior to the effective date of termination to the extent that BLI cannot reasonably cancel or reallocate such work.\\n\\n13.3.6 Non-Limitation of Remedies.

Except as required by Applicable Law or to enforce an arbitrators\\' award, neither Party may disclose the existence, contents or results of an arbitration brought in accordance with this Agreement, or the evidence produced by its opposing Parties, or any analysis or summaries derived from such evidence. The Parties agree that all applicable statutes of limitation and Page 64 of 85\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntime-based defenses (such as estoppel and laches) will be tolled while the procedures set forth in this Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution) are pending.

At all times while any claim, action, suit or other proceeding between the Parties and/or any of their Affiliates (or among the Parties and/or any of their Affiliates and one or more Third Parties) arising out of or relating to this Agreement is pending in any court of competent jurisdiction, no dispute that is justiciable and can be joined to such pending claim, action, suit or other proceeding shall be submitted to arbitration pursuant to Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution) without both Parties\\' mutual consent and, instead, either Party may join such dispute to the pending claim, action, suit or other proceeding by including such dispute in its pleadings or amending its pleadings. In the event that a motion to amend is required to achieve such joinder, the non- moving Party shall consent to such motion.\\n\\n14.6 Entire Agreement; Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto, sets forth and constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and all prior agreements, understandings, promises and representations, whether written or oral, with respect thereto are superseded hereby. This Agreement may not be amended except by a writing signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. The failure of a Party at any time or times to require performance of any provision hereof will in no manner affect its rights at a later time to enforce the same. To be valid, a waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the Party having the right that is waived or to whom the obligation to be waived is owed.\\n\\n14.7 English Language. This Agreement will be written and executed in, and all other communications under or in connection with this Agreement will be in, the English language. Any translation into any other language will not be an official version thereof, and in the event of any conflict in interpretation between the English version and such translation, the English version will control.\\n\\n14.8 Force Majeure. Any delay in the performance of any of the duties or obligations (other than payment obligations) of either Party hereto caused by a Force Majeure Event (defined below) shall not be considered a breach of this Agreement and the time required for performance shall be extended for a period equal to the period of such delay. \"Force Majeure Event\" shall mean acts of God, acts of the public enemy, war, terrorism, insurrections, riots, injunctions, embargoes, fires, explosions, floods, or other unforeseeable causes beyond the reasonable control and without the fault or negligence of the Party who is so prevented or delayed from fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement by such Force Majeure Event (the \"Affected Party\"). The Affected Party shall give prompt written notice to the other Party of such cause and shall take whatever reasonable steps are appropriate in the other Party\\'s discretion to relieve the effect of such cause as rapidly as possible. The Party not directly affected by the Force Majeure Event shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with written notice effective upon receipt if Force Page 65 of 85\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMajeure Event continues to prevent performance or compliance in any material respect by the other Party for a period of more than [***] ([***]) days or should [***] ([***]) Force Majeure Events apply to the performance of such other Party during any [***] (each a \"Extended Force Majeure Event\").\\n\\n14.9 Further Assurances. Each Party will duly execute and deliver, or cause to be duly executed and delivered, such further instruments and do and cause to be done such further acts and things, including the filing of such assignments, agreements, documents, and instruments, as may be necessary or as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with this Agreement or to carry out more effectively the provisions and purposes hereof, or to better assure and confirm unto such other Party its rights and remedies under this Agreement.\\n\\n14.10 Third Party Beneficiaries. There are no Third Party beneficiaries under this Agreement, except to the extent a Third Party is indemnified pursuant to Article 12 (Indemnification; Insurance); provided that, in no event will any Third Party entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article 12 (Indemnification; Insurance) be allowed to enforce the terms thereof against a Party.\\n\\n14.11 Export Control. This Agreement is made subject to any restrictions concerning the export of products or technical information from the United States or other countries which may be imposed upon the Parties from time to time. Each Party agrees that it will not export, directly or indirectly, any technical information acquired from the other Party under this Agreement or any products using such technical information to a location or in a manner that at the time of export requires an export license or other governmental approval, without first obtaining the applicable license, approval, or written consent to do so from the appropriate agency or other governmental entity.\\n\\n14.12 References. Unless otherwise specified, (a) references in this Agreement to any Article, Section, Exhibit or Schedule will mean references to such Article, Section, Exhibit or Schedule of this Agreement, (b) references in any Section to any clause are references to such clause of such Section and (c) references to any agreement, instrument or other document in this Agreement refer to such agreement, instrument or other document as originally executed or, if subsequently amended, replaced or supplemented from time to time, as so amended, replaced or supplemented and in effect at the relevant time of reference thereto.\\n\\n14.13 Attachments. In the event of any inconsistencies between this Agreement and any Exhibits, Schedules or other attachments hereto, the terms of this Agreement will control, unless the relevant Exhibit, Schedule or other attachment explicitly references its inconsistency with this Agreement and states that it shall control.\\n\\n14.14 Non-Solicit. Neither Party will, [***], directly or indirectly with or through any Person, solicit for employment any Person who is an employee of the other Party; provided, however, that general solicitation of the public for employment shall not constitute a solicitation hereunder so long as such general solicitation is not designed to target any such Person. In the event that a Party solicits and then hires an employee of the other Party in violation of this Section 14.4 (Non-Solicit), the hiring Party shall, [***], within [***] ([***]) days of such hire, pay the other Party an amount equal to the [***] cash compensation actually paid to the individual Page 66 of 85\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n([***]) by the non-hiring Party in the immediately prior calendar year and, further, if the individual solicited and then hired in violation of this is a Key Person under Section 5.4.1(b) (Dedicated FTEs; Key Persons), then BLI shall have [***] ([***]) months to identify an employee as the individual to replace such Key Person and any (a) [***] or (b) [***], in each case (a)-(b), to the extent due to the absence of such Key Person performing a Workflow Development Plan upon which the Key Person was engaged, shall be deemed waived for that [***] month period.\\n\\n14.15 Interpretation. All headings are for convenience only and will not affect the meaning of any provision of this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge that each Party has read and negotiated the language used in this Agreement. Because both Parties participated in negotiating and drafting this Agreement, no rule of construction will apply to this Agreement which construes ambiguous language in favor of or against either Party by reason of that Party\\'s role in drafting this Agreement. Except where the context expressly requires otherwise, (a) the use of any gender herein will be deemed to encompass references to either or both genders, and the use of the singular will be deemed to include the plural (and vice versa), (b) the words \"include,\" \"includes\" and \"including\" will be deemed to be followed by the phrase \"without limitation,\" whether or not so appearing herein, (c) the word \"will\" will be construed to have the same meaning and effect as the word \"shall,\" (d) any reference herein to any Person will be construed to include the Person\\'s successors and permitted assigns, (e) the words \"herein,\" \"hereof\" and \"hereunder,\" and words of similar import, will be construed to refer to this Agreement in its entirety and not to any particular provision hereof, (f) references to any Applicable Law, rule or regulation, or article, section or other division thereof, will be deemed to include the then-current amendments thereto or any replacement or successor Applicable Law, rule or regulation thereof and (g) the term \"or\" will be interpreted in the inclusive sense commonly associated with the term \"and/or.\"\\n\\n14.16 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered by facsimile, electronic transmission or by mail delivery, will be deemed an original and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument.\\n\\n[Signature Page Directly Follows] Page 67 of 85\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed as of the Effective Date by their respective duly authorized representatives.

Selectivity at β adrenoceptors, relative to β and β  adrenoceptors, similar or superior to that of formoterol, assessed in assays determining equi- potent molar ratios relative to that of isoprenaline (isoproterenol). 5. Selectivity at non-β adrenoceptors >100. 6. No significant inhibition of the hERG potassium channel at a concentration at least 30 fold greater than the anticipated therapeutic maximum concentration in plasma. 7. Duration of agonist activity in vivo to be clearly longer than that of salmeterol. This would be at least 72 hours in the Theravance model. The exact duration criterion for either the GSK or the Theravance model might be modified in the light of forthcoming clinical data from the program. 8. Stable compound suitable for formulation to pursue FTIM studies, with crystalline form identified. 9. Oral bioavailability to be less than 10% in the rat and less than 25% in the dog. 10. No significant generation of markedly active metabolite(s) in vitro. 11. Irritation to the respiratory tract no worse than salmeterol in a non-GLP 7-day inhaled rat study. </s>\n",
