If       such a claim is made or appears likely to be made, Customer agrees to       permit IBM to enable Customer to continue to use the Materials or Base       Components, or to modify them, or replace them with non-infringing       Materials or Base Components that are at least functionally equivalent. If       IBM determines that none of these alternatives is reasonably available,       Customer agrees to return the Materials or Base Components (if in       Customer\\'s possession) to IBM on IBM\\'s written request. IBM will give       Customer a credit equal to the amount Customer paid IBM for the applicable       Materials or for use of the applicable Base Components up to a maximum of       twelve (12) months of applicable charges. This is IBM\\'s entire obligation       to Customer with regard to any claim of infringement. Notwithstanding the       foregoing, IBM is not responsible for third party claims based on:\\n\\n      1.    anything Customer provides which is incorporated into the Materials;\\n\\n      2.    Customer\\'s modification of the Materials;\\n\\n                                       5\\n\\n      3.    the combination, operation, or use of the Materials with any             product, data, or apparatus that IBM did not provide; or\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      4.    non-IBM hardware, software, or data, including those that may be in             the Base Components.\\n\\n8.2   Indemnification by Customer\\n\\na.    Customer will defend IBM and its Enterprise and their employees, officers,       and directors against any third party claim (and pay all damages that a       court of competent jurisdiction awards, or which Customer agrees in any       final settlement to such third party and any reasonable attorneys\\' fees       and expenses of defense incurred by IBM):\\n\\n      1.    that Content or Customer\\'s use of the Services violates Customer\\'s             obligation in Section 11.2(b);\\n\\n      2.    that Customer Components infringe that party\\'s patent or copyright;\\n\\n      3.    that is brought by a Services Recipient and is related, directly or             indirectly, to the Services; or\\n\\n      4.    arising out of or related to a mechanics\\' lien Customer is required             to cancel and discharge pursuant to this Agreement.\\n\\nb.    For indemnification under this Section 8.2, IBM will:\\n\\n      1.    promptly notify Customer in writing of the claim; and\\n\\n      2.    allow Customer to control, and will cooperate with Customer in, the             defense and any related settlement negotiations.\\n\\nc.    Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein, Customer       shall be relieved of its indemnification duty or obligation to the extent       that IBM\\'s bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence. breach of       its contractual obligations hereunder is a cause of the damages suffered       by the Services Recipient.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 9.0   Limitation of Liability\\n\\n9.1   IBM\\'s Limitation of Liability\\n\\nCircumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM\\'s part or other liability, Customer is entitled to recover damages from IBM.
