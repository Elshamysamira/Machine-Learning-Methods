No single or partial exercise of any right or remedy with respect to one breach of this Agreement precludes the simultaneous or subsequent exercise of any other right or remedy with respect to the same or a different breach.\\n\\n3.10 Delivery, Performance and Acceptance\\n\\n(a) Vendor acknowledges that AT&T is responsible for the deployment of the FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (the \"NPSBN\") in accordance with the terms of AT&T\\'s agreement with the FirstNet Authority and that AT&T has provided certain terms of such agreement to Vendor but has not provided Vendor with a copy of such agreement with the FirstNet Authority. Therefore, Vendor understands generally that AT&T\\'s business requires prompt Delivery of Material and provision of Services by the specified Delivery Dates. Furthermore, the Parties agree that dates for Delivery of Material and Services are firm subject to any Excusable Delay, time is of the essence, and, subject to any Excusable Delay, Vendor will complete such Delivery in strict conformance with the Specifications.\\n\\n(b) Vendor shall perform or cause to be performed testing sufficient to ensure that all of the Material and Deliverables perform in accordance with the Specifications, including all of the Cell Site optimization and testing contemplated by the Build Addendum. If testing indicates that any of the Cell Sites (or any of the Material or Deliverables relating thereto) does not conform to the Specifications, then Vendor shall notify AT&T, in writing, of such non- conformance promptly following Vendor\\'s knowledge of such non- conformance. AT&T will advise Vendor whether Vendor should Deliver the non-conforming Cell Site or any of the Deliverables or Material relating thereto. In the event AT&T and Vendor agree in a signed writing to Deliver non-conforming Cell Sites or any of the Deliverables or Material relating thereto (\"Provisional Location Acceptance\"), Vendor shall use all commercially reasonable efforts promptly to cure any such non- conformance after Provisional Location Acceptance of\\n\\nProprietary and Confidential This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties. 12\\n\\nSource: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe non-conforming Cell Site; provided, however, that if Vendor has not cured all such non- conformance with respect to the Cell Site within nine (9) months following Provisional Location Acceptance (or sixty (60) days if the non-conformance is caused by the existence of a Lien, and in each case subject to an Excusable Delay), then AT&T may elect in its sole discretion, to complete any outstanding work, and recoup any costs by an offset against the Maintenance Fees due to Vendor for all Cell Sites. If such non-conforming Cell Site has not been cured within such nine (9) month cure period (or 60-day cure period in the case of a Lien), AT&T shall have no further obligation to pay any Maintenance Fees to Vendor with respect to such non-conforming Cell Site until the non-conformance has been cured. Provisional Location Acceptance of any such non-conforming Cell Site or receipt of any of the Deliverables or Material relating thereto shall not constitute Location Acceptance and shall not constitute a waiver of any of AT&T\\'s rights, warranties, or remedies under this Agreement or elsewhere, including Termination Remedies under the Build Addendum. Location Acceptance of any such non-conforming Cell Site shall not occur until all non-conformance has been cured; provided, that AT&T shall begin making Structured Payments for such Cell Site upon Provisional Location Acceptance in the same manner as if it were Location Acceptance.\\n\\n(c) In no event shall Location Acceptance be deemed to occur absent a signed writing from AT&T prior to the date Vendor completes its Delivery of all Material and Services in accordance with the Specifications related to the Cell Site as required by the Build Addendum.\\n\\n(d) If AT&T advises Vendor of, or Vendor becomes aware of a landlord complaint, Vendor shall, if necessary, promptly respond to the landlord complaint, shall commence any agreed upon corrections promptly, and shall diligently pursue the same until completion.\\n\\n(e) In addition to the provisions set forth in this Section, AT&T shall be able to exercise any or all remedies available to it under the Build Addendum and Maintenance Addendum.\\n\\n3.11 Entire Agreement. Except to the extent otherwise expressly referenced herein, including the matters set forth in the Transport Agreement and the Master License Agreement, this Agreement and all addendums, appendices, exhibits, attachments, schedules and documents incorporated herein by reference, constitutes the final, complete, and exclusive expression of the Parties\\' agreement on the matters contained in this Agreement.

Except to the extent set forth in the Transport Agreement and the Master License Agreement, all prior written and oral negotiations and agreements, and all contemporaneous oral negotiations and agreements, between the Parties on the matters contained in this Agreement are expressly merged into and superseded by this Agreement. The Parties do not intend that the provisions of this Agreement be explained, supplemented, or qualified through evidence of trade usage or any prior course of dealings or any course of performance under any prior agreement. In entering into this Agreement, neither Party has relied upon any statement, estimate, forecast, projection, representation, warranty, action or agreement of the other Party except for those expressly contained in this Agreement.

After Vendor provides written notice to AT&T of any Force Majeure Event in accordance with the preceding sentence, the Parties shall extend the applicable Delivery Date or Completion Date for the length of such Force Majeure Event and, subject to Subsection (b) below, such Force Majeure Event shall be an Excusable Delay.\\n\\n(b) If Vendor is the Party whose performance is prevented or delayed by a Force Majeure Event and AT&T determines that the Force Majeure Event is reasonably likely to cause a material delay of the ultimate Delivery Date or Completion Date for any Cell Site, then AT&T may elect to, after consultation with Vendor and good faith discussion to negotiate another resolution:\\n\\n(i) terminate its obligations with respect to each Cell Site affected by or related to such Force Majeure Event under this Agreement and exercise any of the Termination Remedies set forth in the Build Addendum, in each case without liability to Vendor; provided that AT&T shall pay to Vendor, an amount equal to demonstrated costs incurred by Vendor for any Work completed (in accordance with applicable Specifications and requirements) to the extent such Work is transferable to and usable by AT&T as of the effective time of termination of the applicable terminated Cell Site, which amount shall not exceed $[***]; or\\n\\n(ii) suspend this Agreement or any part hereof for the duration of such Force Majeure Event solely with respect to any Cell Site affected by or related to such Force Majeure Event, obtain Work elsewhere (including AT&T\\'s performance of the Work itself), at AT&T\\'s cost and expense (which shall reduce the Structured Payments applicable to such Cell Site by such amount, but in no event shall such reduction cause the Structured Payments to be less than an amount equal to the demonstrated costs incurred by Vendor up to the date of suspension), and provide notice to Vendor when AT&T desires for Vendor to resume its performance under this Agreement for the remaining Work at such Cell Site.\\n\\n3.13 Government Contract Provisions and Flow Downs\\n\\n(a) To the extent that Vendor\\'s performance is required to comply with certain executive orders (including E.O. 11246 and E.O. 13201) and statutes (including Section 503 of the\\n\\nProprietary and Confidential This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties. 14\\n\\nSource: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; the Vietnam Era Veteran\\'s Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974; Section 8116 of the Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Pub.

Subject to AT&T\\'s obligation to reimburse or indemnify Vendor as set forth in Subsection (c) or (d) below, respectively, Vendor\\'s duty to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the AT&T Indemnified Parties against any Third Party Loss extends to any Third Party Loss that may be caused or alleged to be caused in part by the negligence of any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent that such indemnification is permitted by applicable Law.\\n\\n(b) AT&T shall promptly notify Vendor in writing of any claim, demand, suit, cause of action or legal proceeding that may give rise to a claim against Vendor for defense and indemnification under this Section 3.15. If AT&T fails to give notice, Vendor is still obligated to indemnify, hold harmless and defend the AT&T Indemnified Parties, except that Vendor is not liable for any Litigation Expense that AT&T incurs before the time when notice is given or for any Loss or Liability to the extent that Vendor can show that such delay or failure to provide notice actually and materially prejudiced it in defending against such Loss or Liability.\\n\\n(c) Vendor shall conduct the defense (employing one or more competent attorneys from a nationally recognized law firm), at Vendor\\'s expense, against any claim, demand, suit or cause of action within the scope of Subsection (a) above, whether or not litigation is actually commenced or the allegations are meritorious and, upon AT&T\\'s request, keep AT&T informed as to the progress of such defense.

To the extent that Vendor pays any part of a judgment, award or settlement with respect to the Third Party Loss and any other expenses related to the resolution of the Third Party Loss, including costs, interest, and Attorneys\\' Fees, as a result of being self-insured (including any deductible) or as a result of insurance coverage being insufficient to cover the amount of the judgment, award or settlement, upon final resolution of the claim, demand, suit or cause of action, AT&T shall reimburse Vendor for the pro-rata portion of any such payment based on the AT&T Indemnified Parties\\' fault relative to Vendor\\'s fault.\\n\\n(d) In addition to AT&T\\'s obligation to reimburse Vendor as set forth in Subsection (c) above, AT&T shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Vendor Indemnified Parties against any Third Party Loss arising solely from or in connection with, resulting solely from, or relating solely to (i) the AT&T Provided Equipment furnished by AT&T or (ii) the negligent or intentionally wrongful acts or omissions of any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties under this Agreement; in each case in the same manner as set forth in Subsection (b) and in the first four sentences of Subsection (c), with the appropriate changes having been made.\\n\\n(e) Subject to AT&T\\'s obligation to reimburse or indemnify Vendor as set forth in Subsection (c) and (d) above, respectively, Vendor shall bring no claim or action for indemnification, contribution, or subrogation against any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties nor shall Vendor implead any of them in any action brought by another, based on injury to the person or death arising out or relating to Vendor\\'s performance under this Agreement. If, through any such action, Vendor ever acquires a Lien on a judgment against any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties, then Vendor shall assign such Lien to AT&T.

Accordingly, the amount with respect to which AT&T is required to reimburse Vendor its pro-rata portion will be reduced by any Insurance Proceeds theretofore actually paid on behalf of Vendor in respect of the related Third Party Loss.

Information of a disclosing Party shall be deemed to be confidential or proprietary only if it is clearly marked or otherwise identified by the disclosing Party as being confidential or proprietary, provided that if it is orally or visually disclosed (including Information conveyed to an answering machine, voice mail box or similar medium), the disclosing Party shall designate it as confidential or proprietary at the time of such disclosure, however, failure to do so shall not prevent such Information from receiving the protections afforded to it in this Section 3.16. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a disclosing Party shall not have any such obligation to so mark or identify, or to so designate, Information that the disclosing Party discloses to or is otherwise obtained by the other Party\\'s employees, contractors, or representatives (i) who are located on the disclosing Party\\'s premises; (ii) who access the disclosing Party\\'s systems; or (iii) who otherwise obtain AT&T Information and/or AT&T Customer Information in connection with this Agreement; any such Information so disclosed shall automatically be deemed to be confidential and proprietary. Additionally, the failure to mark or designate information as being confidential or proprietary will not waive the confidentiality where it is reasonably obvious, under the circumstances surrounding disclosure, that the Information is confidential or proprietary; any such Information so disclosed or obtained shall automatically be deemed to be confidential and proprietary. For greater certainty, Information provided by either Party to the other Party prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement in connection with a separate\\n\\nProprietary and Confidential This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties. 18\\n\\nSource: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnon-disclosure agreement (howsoever denominated) is also subject to the terms of this Agreement.

The \"Proportionate Share\" payable by Vendor shall be a portion of the Covered Loss determined, not at AT&T\\'s sole discretion, but rather on an objectively fair and equitable basis (taking into account the relevant facts and circumstances and using the same standards that would be applied by a court or other neutral adjudicator under applicable Law) to be attributable to Vendor based on the relative materiality of the role played by the applicable Provided Elements in the Combination Claim. If Vendor believes AT&T\\'s assessment of Vendor\\'s Proportionate Share is not fair and equitable, then Vendor\\'s Proportionate Share shall be determined, insofar as possible, through good faith negotiation between the Parties; provided, however, that a failure of the Parties to agree on Vendor\\'s Proportionate Share shall not relieve Vendor of its obligations to pay its Proportionate Share under this Section. Vendor shall make payments in satisfaction of its Proportionate Share obligation whenever such payments become due. In no event shall Vendor be liable, with regard to a Combination Claim, for more than its Proportionate Share. If the Parties cannot mutually agree on Vendor\\'s Proportionate Share within sixty (60) days of AT&T\\'s providing Vendor with AT&T\\'s assessment of Vendor\\'s Proportionate Share, either Party may notify the other Party that a dispute has occurred, at which point the Parties shall follow the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 4.8 (\"Dispute Resolution\"), provided that in preparation for the escalation set forth in Section 4.8(a), Vendor shall notify AT&T in writing of the percentage which Vendor believes, in good faith, constitutes Vendor\\'s Proportionate Share (\"Vendor\\'s Minimum Share\"). If arbitration is invoked under Section 4.8(b), all arbitrators shall be qualified by education, training, and experience in both the intellectual property law (e.g., patent law) and the technology relevant to any dispute under this Section. Throughout the course of attempting to resolve the dispute, Vendor shall continue to pay Vendor\\'s Minimum Share to AT&T as such payments become due. When Vendor\\'s Proportionate Share is finally determined (either through escalation or arbitration, as the case may be) (\"Determined Proportionate Share\"), there shall be a true-up and Vendor shall promptly pay to AT&T the aggregate amount of past underpayments (i.e., the difference between monies previously due computed at the Determined Proportionate Share, minus those amounts that Vendor had actually paid to AT&T), if any. Thereafter, Vendor shall promptly pay its Determined Proportionate Share. (In the event that the Determined Proportionate Share is less than the Vendor\\'s Minimum Share, AT&T shall refund to Vendor any past overpayments.) In no event shall AT&T\\'s acceptance of payments computed at Vendor\\'s Minimum Share prejudice or waive any of AT&T\\'s rights under this Agreement.\\n\\nProprietary and Confidential This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties. 22\\n\\nSource: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(iii) AT&T shall have sole control over the defense of (1) any Combination Claim and (2) any other Covered Claim that involves Vendor and one or more other suppliers of AT&T or its Affiliates ((1) and (2) being hereinafter referred to separately and collectively as a \"Compound Claim\").

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, AT&T is not transferring or granting to Vendor any right, title, or interest in or to (or granting to Vendor any license or other permissions in or to) any or all: (i) Items created by or on behalf of AT&T or directly or indirectly provided to Vendor (in any form, including, without limitation, verbally) by or on behalf of AT&T or its third party providers, including the AT&T Provided Equipment (as such term is defined in the Build Addendum) (\"AT&T Provided Items\"); (ii) Paid-For Development or (iii) Intellectual Property Rights, including, without limitation, any Intellectual Property Rights in or to any AT&T Provided Items or Paid- For Development. The sole exception to the foregoing reservation of rights is that AT&T hereby grants Vendor a limited, nonexclusive, non-transferable license (that shall automatically terminate upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement), under any rights owned by AT&T, to use the AT&T Provided Items and Paid- For Development solely as instructed by AT&T and to the extent necessary for Vendor to perform its obligations under this Agreement, subject further to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In no way expanding the foregoing license, said license in no manner permits Vendor to (and Vendor hereby promises not to without the explicit prior written and signed consent of AT&T Intellectual Property, LLC (\"ATTIP Consent\")) make use of any AT&T Provided Items, Paid- For Development or AT&T Intellectual Property Rights either for the benefit of any third party or other than as instructed in writing by AT&T (AT&T may be willing, in its sole discretion, to grant ATTIP Consent in exchange for appropriate additional compensation). Paid-For Development and AT&T Provided Items shall constitute AT&T Information under this Agreement.\\n\\n3.30 Publicity.

To the extent that any disclosure required to be made by Vendor to the Securities and Exchange Commission has been previously reviewed by AT&T, then Vendor shall not be required to provide AT&T with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon prior to such disclosure being made thereafter so long as no substantive changes have been made thereto. A breach of this \"Publicity\" Section shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.\\n\\n3.31 Records and Audits\\n\\n(a) Vendor shall maintain complete and accurate records relating to the Work and the performance of this Agreement. AT&T and its auditors (including internal audit staff and external auditors) and governmental authorities shall have the right to review such records (\"AT&T Audits\") held and created by Vendor, to verify the following:\\n\\n(i) the accuracy of Vendor\\'s invoices and AT&T\\'s payment obligations hereunder;\\n\\n(ii) that the Work charged for was actually performed;\\n\\n(iii) that the Services have been and are being provided in accordance with this Agreement;\\n\\n(iv) the integrity of Vendor\\'s systems that process, store, support, maintain, and transmit AT&T data;\\n\\n(v) Vendor\\'s records relating to the performance of Vendor\\'s Subcontractors with respect to any portion of the Services; and\\n\\n(vi) that Vendor and its Subcontractors are complying with Section 3.6 hereof.\\n\\nWhen the FirstNet Authority or other governmental authority requests to review Vendor\\'s records, AT&T and its auditors will review these records first if the FirstNet Authority or other governmental authority permits such review, and provide the records to the requesting governmental authority; provided, however, the FirstNet Authority and other governmental authorities retain the right to perform audits independent of AT&T.\\n\\nProprietary and Confidential This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties. 34\\n\\nSource: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) Subject to Subsection (g) below, Vendor shall provide and shall require that its Subcontractors provide to AT&T, its auditors (including internal audit staff and external auditors), and governmental authorities access at all reasonable times to:\\n\\n(i) any facility at which the Services or any portion thereof are being performed;\\n\\n(ii) systems and assets used to provide the Services or any portion thereof;\\n\\n(iii) Vendor employees and Subcontractor employees providing the Services or any portion thereof; and\\n\\n(iv) all Vendor and Subcontractor records, including financial records relating to the invoices and payment obligations and supporting documentation, pertaining to the Services.\\n\\nThe scope of AT&T Audits shall also include:\\n\\n(i) practices and procedures used in performing the Services;\\n\\n(ii) systems, communications and information technology used in performing the Services;\\n\\n(iii) general controls and security practices and procedures;\\n\\n(iv) supporting information and calculations regarding invoices and compliance with service requirements;\\n\\n(v) quality initiatives and quality assurance; and\\n\\n(vi) compliance with the terms of this Agreement.\\n\\nAT&T\\'s access to the records and other supporting documentation shall include the right to inspect and photocopy Vendor\\'s documentation and the documentation of its Subcontractors as provided to Vendor, and the right to retain copies thereof outside of their physical location with appropriate safeguards, if such retention is deemed reasonably necessary by AT&T and only to the extent that all such records are maintained by AT&T in accordance with Section 3.16 hereof.\\n\\n(c) AT&T Audits may be conducted once a year (or more frequently if requested by governmental authorities who regulate AT&T\\'s business, if required by applicable Law or if auditors require follow-up access to complete audit inquiries or if an audit uncovers any problems or deficiencies), upon at least ten (10) business days advance notice (unless otherwise mandated by Law) and during business hours. Vendor will cooperate, and will ensure that its Subcontractors cooperate, in the AT&T Audits, and will make the information reasonably required to conduct the AT&T Audits available on a timely basis.\\n\\n(d) If, as a result of an AT&T Audit, AT&T determines that Vendor has not performed or has unsatisfactorily performed any obligation under this Agreement, then Vendor will promptly remedy the non-performance or unsatisfactory performance.\\n\\nProprietary and Confidential This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties. 35\\n\\nSource: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(e) Vendor will maintain and retain the records set forth in Subsection (a) during the term of the Agreement and for three (3) years thereafter (unless a discovery or legal hold request is made with respect to such records, in which case Vendor shall retain such records until AT&T notifies Vendor that such discovery or legal hold request has expired). Vendor will provide AT&T, at AT&T\\'s request and cost, with paper and electronic copies of documents and information reasonably necessary to verify Vendor\\'s compliance with this Agreement. Upon notification by AT&T of a discovery or legal hold request, Vendor shall fully cooperate with such request and immediately preserve any Vendor records covered by such request and promptly provide such Vendor records requested by AT&T related to the inquiry.\\n\\n(f) Except as provided in Subsection (d), all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by AT&T in connection with an AT&T Audit shall be paid by AT&T. Vendor shall be solely responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by Vendor in connection with its obligations under this Section. In the event that either Party requires that an audit be performed by an independent auditor, unless otherwise specified herein, the Party requesting such independent auditor will be responsible for the costs and expenses associated with the independent auditor.\\n\\n(g) With respect to AT&T requests for audits or inspections of Vendor\\'s Subcontractors, the following applies:\\n\\n(i) If Vendor\\'s agreement with its applicable Subcontractor permits an AT&T Audit, AT&T shall be permitted to conduct such audit directly or through a third party representative. Vendor shall work with AT&T in facilitating the Subcontractor\\'s cooperation for an expeditious and thorough audit or inspection.\\n\\n(ii) If Vendor\\'s contract with its applicable Subcontractor precludes AT&T from directly conducting an audit or inspection, Vendor shall use reasonable best efforts to enable AT&T to perform an audit of the Subcontractor with Vendor coordinating the audit process. Failing those efforts, Vendor shall, upon AT&T\\'s request and at AT&T\\'s expense, conduct the audit or inspection on behalf of AT&T, subject to terms agreed to by Vendor and AT&T for the Subcontractor audit, such as areas to be audited, applicable fees, and the timeframe for reporting audit results to AT&T. If AT&T\\'s request for a Vendor audit or inspection arises from, in AT&T\\'s good faith opinion, materially or consistently deficient Service provided by the Subcontractor under AT&T\\'s account, and the audit in both Parties\\' opinions confirms such deficiencies, Vendor shall not charge AT&T a fee for the Vendor\\'s audit of its Subcontractor.\\n\\n(iii) If Vendor\\'s contract with its applicable Subcontractor does not allow Vendor access to the facilities and systems of Subcontractor required to conduct the audit described in Subsection (b) above, then Vendor shall provide a list of such Subcontractors and the services being provided by such Subcontractor to AT&T for its review. To the extent AT&T deems it reasonably necessary to require such access, then Vendor will renegotiate its contract with the applicable Subcontractor in order to obtain the audit rights described in Subsection (b) above.\\n\\nProprietary and Confidential This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties. 36\\n\\nSource: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.32 Restricted Entities. Vendor may not deliver or obtain any Material or Deliverables from or use any Restricted Entities to provide any Services under this Agreement, without prior written consent from AT&T. Vendor may not use, in connection with any Deliverable, Material or Service provided hereunder, any element, equipment, location, instrumentality or the like where a Restricted Entity has a security interest in that element, equipment, location, instrumentality or the like. Vendor may not obtain financing from any Restricted Entity or use any Cell Sites or Material owned, leased from, operated or financed by any Restricted Entity.\\n\\n3.33 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force if both the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not affected in any manner that is materially adverse to either Party by severing the provision determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable.\\n\\n3.34 Supplier Citizenship and Sustainability. Vendor shall conduct business with an abiding respect for corporate citizenship, sustainability, and human rights (\"Citizenship and Sustainability\"). Upon AT&T\\'s request, which request may only be made once per calendar year, Vendor shall provide to AT&T reasonable information, reports, or survey responses to demonstrate Vendor\\'s operation of its business in the context of Citizenship and Sustainability.\\n\\n3.35 Survival of Obligations. Obligations and rights under this Agreement that by their nature would reasonably continue beyond the termination or expiration of this Agreement (including those in the Sections entitled \"Compliance with Laws,\" \"Construction and Interpretation,\" \"Cumulative Remedies,\" \"Entire Agreement,\" \"Governing Law,\" \"Information,\" \"Indemnity,\" \"Infringement,\" \"Insurance,\" \"Limitation of Damages,\" \"Order of Precedence,\" \"Ownership of Paid-For Development, Use and Reservation of Rights,\" \"Publicity,\" \"Severability,\" \"AT&T Supplier Information Security Requirements (SISR),\" \"Warranty,\" \"Customer Information,\" \"Dispute Resolution\" and the representations, warranties, indemnities and Termination Remedies) will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\\n\\n3.36 Taxes\\n\\n(a) Vendor shall invoice AT&T the amount of any federal excise, state, and local transaction taxes imposed upon the sale of Material, Delivery of Deliverables, and provision of Services under this Agreement. All such taxes must be stated as separate items on the applicable Material, Deliverable, or Services invoice listing the taxing jurisdiction imposing the tax. Installation, labor and other non-taxable charges must be separately stated. AT&T shall pay all applicable taxes to Vendor that are stated on and at the time the Material, Deliverables, or Services invoice is submitted by Vendor. Vendor shall remit taxes to the appropriate taxing authorities. Vendor shall honor tax exemption certificates, and other appropriate documents, which AT&T provides to Vendor, pursuant to relevant tax provisions of the taxing jurisdiction providing the exemption.\\n\\nProprietary and Confidential This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties. 37\\n\\nSource: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) Vendor will pay any penalty, interest, additional tax, or other charge that may be levied or assessed as a result of the delay or failure of Vendor, for any reason other than AT&T\\'s failure to reimburse Vendor in a timely manner for such amounts, to pay any tax or file any return or information required by law, rule, or regulation or by this Agreement to be paid or filed by Vendor.\\n\\n(c) Upon AT&T\\'s request, the Parties shall consult with respect to the basis and rates upon which Vendor shall pay any taxes or fees for which AT&T is obligated to reimburse Vendor under this Agreement. If AT&T determines that, in good faith and pursuant to applicable Law, any such taxes or fees are not payable or should be paid on a basis less than the full price or at rates less than the full tax rate, AT&T shall notify Vendor in writing of such determinations, Vendor shall make payment in accordance with such determinations, and AT&T shall be responsible for such determinations. If collection is sought by the taxing authority for a greater amount of taxes than that so determined by AT&T, Vendor shall promptly notify AT&T. If AT&T desires to contest such collection, AT&T shall promptly notify Vendor. Vendor shall cooperate with AT&T in contesting such determination, but AT&T shall be responsible and shall reimburse Vendor for any tax, interest, or penalty in excess of AT&T\\'s determination and shall reimburse Vendor for Litigation Expense incurred by Vendor in connection with contesting such determination.\\n\\n(d) If the parties agree, where such agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, that AT&T has paid Vendor for any taxes in excess of the amount that AT&T is obligated to pay Vendor under this Agreement, AT&T and Vendor shall consult in good faith to determine the appropriate method(s) to seek recovery of such excess payments, which method(s) may include, but are not limited to, (i) Vendor crediting any excess payments against tax amounts or other payments due from AT&T solely to the extent Vendor has successfully made corresponding adjustments to its payments to the relevant tax authority, (ii) Vendor timely filing claims for refund and any other documents required to recover any excess payments and Vendor promptly remitting to AT&T all such refunds and interest received, and (iii) Vendor immediately refunding to AT&T such excess payments.\\n\\n(e) If any taxing authority advises Vendor that it intends to audit Vendor with respect to any taxes for which AT&T is obligated to reimburse Vendor under this Agreement, Vendor shall (i) promptly so notify AT&T, (ii) afford AT&T an opportunity to participate with Vendor in such audit with respect to such taxes, and (iii) keep AT&T fully informed as to the progress of such audit. Except as set forth in Subsection (c) above, each Party shall bear its own expenses with respect to any such audit, and the responsibility for any additional tax, interest, or penalty resulting from such audit is to be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Section 3.36. Vendor\\'s failure to comply with the notification requirements of this Section 3.36 will relieve AT&T of its responsibility to reimburse Vendor for taxes only to the extent that Vendor\\'s failure actually and materially prejudiced AT&T\\'s ability to contest imposition or assessment of those taxes.\\n\\n(f) In addition to its rights under Subsections (c), (d), and (e) above with respect to any tax or tax controversy covered by this Section 3.36, AT&T is entitled to contest, pursuant to applicable Law and tariffs and at its own expense, any tax previously invoiced that AT&T is ultimately\\n\\nProprietary and Confidential This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties. 38\\n\\nSource: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nobligated to pay.

Vendor shall cooperate in any such contest, but AT&T shall reimburse Vendor for Litigation Expense incurred by Vendor in obtaining a refund or credit for AT&T.\\n\\n(g) If either Party is audited by a taxing authority or other governmental entity in connection with taxes under this Section 3.36, the other Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Party being audited in order to respond to any audit inquiries in an appropriate and timely manner, so that the audit and any resulting controversy may be resolved expeditiously.\\n\\n(h) AT&T and Vendor shall reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to any tax planning to minimize taxes.\\n\\n(i) Vendor and any of its Affiliates, as appropriate, receiving payments hereunder shall provide AT&T with a valid United States Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN- E, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, W- 8IMY, or W-9 (or any successor form prescribed by the IRS). AT&T may reduce any payment otherwise due to Vendor in connection with the sale of Material, Delivery of Deliverables, or provision of Services under this Agreement by the amount of any tax imposed on Vendor that AT&T is required to pay directly to a taxing or other governmental authority (\"Withholding Tax\"). Alternatively, if applicable Law permits, AT&T agrees that it will honor a valid exemption certificate or other mandated document evidencing Vendor\\'s exemption from payment of, or liability for, any Withholding Tax as authorized or required by statute, regulation, administrative pronouncement, or other Law of the jurisdiction providing said exemption.

In that event, if Vendor cannot or will not use such alternate FOSS, then AT&T may immediately terminate the relevant purchase or funding commitments under this Agreement, without further cost, expense or liability to AT&T.\\n\\n(c) Vendor represents and warrants to AT&T: (i) that Vendor has satisfied all its obligations to any third parties with respect to all FOSS and the applicable FOSS licenses (including, for example, any obligation to make publicly available the FOSS source code for modifications to such FOSS); (ii) that the FOSS, in the form provided to AT&T, is suitable for the intent and purposes furnished hereunder; (iii) that use of the FOSS in such form for such intent and purposes in no manner creates any added obligation on the part of AT&T (including, for example, the payment of any additional monies), or diminishes, conditions or eliminates any of the rights, title, or interest that Vendor grants AT&T in or to any Deliverables or that Vendor may otherwise provide AT&T under this Agreement; and (iv) that use of the FOSS in such form for such intent and purposes, including, but not limited to, AT&T\\'s use or combination of the FOSS, in the form provided to AT&T, with any proprietary software of AT&T or AT&T\\'s third-party Contractors, does not subject AT&T to any obligation of disclosure or distribution to any third party or to the public of any such proprietary software, or otherwise make such proprietary software subject to the terms of any FOSS license or impair AT&T\\'s or its third-party Contractors\\' rights, title, or interest in or to such proprietary software.\\n\\n(d) In the event that AT&T notifies Vendor or Vendor becomes aware of Vendor\\'s noncompliance with any FOSS license term, then in either case, Vendor shall use all reasonable efforts promptly to cure such noncompliance so as to eliminate risks of public disclosure of proprietary software and prevent disruption of any AT&T business activity. Vendor shall promptly notify AT&T of all actions taken by Vendor to cure such noncompliance. Should AT&T receive notice from any third party alleging acts or omissions which, notwithstanding AT&T\\'s use of the FOSS for the intent and purposes furnished hereunder, constitute noncompliance with any FOSS license term, then promptly upon AT&T\\'s notice to Vendor of such allegation, Vendor shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T against such allegation in accordance with Vendor\\'s obligations to do so as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, in a manner that preserves any proprietary software of AT&T or its third-party Contractors from any public disclosure obligation or any other FOSS license noncompliance allegations.\\n\\n5.1 Execution of Agreement\\n\\n5.1 Transmission of Original Signatures and Executing Multiple Counterparts.
